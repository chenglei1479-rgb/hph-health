## ✨ Highlights

- **Paginated document review.** Preview gains paginated Office reading with search controls (#3024) and paged PowerPoint review, so long documents and decks read comfortably inside the app. (#2991)
- **Enrichr gene-set enrichment.** The genes connector adds Enrichr tools: browse enrichment libraries and score your gene set against them. (#2996)
- **Compact library preview.** The workspace sidebar gains a compact library preview for quick scans without leaving your flow. (#3030)
- **Windows signing, completed.** Code signing now covers every bundled executable, including the notebook runtime runners. (#3001, #3011)

## 🔧 Improvements

- Windows code signing now covers all bundled executables, including signed notebook runtime runners that are verified on startup. (#3001, #3011)

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Preview and interface** — the PDF reading tab font size matches the file header (#3036); tooltips appear on collapsed sidebar icons (#3017); row hit targets align with their hover surfaces (#3013); bubble entry motion is skipped during warm hover switches (#3032); entry motion is skipped when switching citation previews (#3038).
- **Notebook** — kernel recovery fences are isolated by lane so one kernel's recovery never blocks another (#3031).
- **Sessions and recovery** — conversation saves defer while runs are active (#3012); failed retries stay recoverable and dismissible (#3019); run error notices can be dismissed (#3002); the archive recovery gate is scoped to affected projects (#3023); renamed diagnostic exports receive an archive suffix (#3022).
- **Connectors and literature** — native file access honors granted folders (#3021); Crossref abstracts import during metadata completion (#3020); classification selects the first model for both features (#3006).
- **Skills and session packages** — skills package metadata and managed Python runtimes are handled correctly (#3033); session-package exports allow numeric cache usage (#3043); numeric token metrics are preserved during export (#3040).

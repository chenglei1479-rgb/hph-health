// Which security-promise copy the API-key field shows. The English text doubles as the catalog key,
// so this stays a pure, locale-independent decision about the fail-closed safeStorage boundary and
// ProviderForm resolves the result through t(). The `as const` keeps the literal union rather than
// widening to `string`: t() no longer key-checks its argument, so the union is what makes an edit
// here and a stale copy of the same sentence elsewhere fail to compile.

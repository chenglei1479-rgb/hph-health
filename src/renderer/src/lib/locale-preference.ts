// synchronously from localStorage and applied before React renders (see main.tsx and web/bootstrap.ts)
// so the first paint is already in the right language. Both the Electron renderer and the localhost
// web build bootstrap through this module.
//
// Detection reads navigator.languages rather than the host OS locale on purpose. In the web build the
// backend may run on a machine whose OS language differs from the person using the browser; the
// browser's list is the one that describes the reader. In Electron, the renderer synchronizes this
// persisted choice to the main process, whose in-memory owner resolves `system` from Electron's
// preferred language list for native surfaces.

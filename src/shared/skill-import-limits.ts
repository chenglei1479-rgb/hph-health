  // A single uploaded bundle may hold many skills, each as a nested .zip/.skill entry. These caps
  // bound the OUTER bundle so a resilient (skip-the-bad, keep-the-good) import can't be turned into a
  // memory bomb: the per-skill caps above still apply to each individual skill once it's unpacked.
  //
  // Largest nested skill archive we'll even attempt to unpack (compressed). An inner archive bigger
  // than this is skipped as "too large" rather than decompressed, so one oversized skill never blocks
  // the rest of the bundle. Sized so a skill archive carrying a large reference asset still unpacks.
  maxSkillArchiveBytes: 64 * 1024 * 1024,
  // Largest uploaded bundle overall (the outer .zip). Generous enough for a bundle of several sizeable
  // skills, bounded so a single upload can't exhaust memory. NOTE: the decoded bundle plus its
  // extracted entries are held in memory during import, so this is the dominant memory bound.
  maxBundleBytes: 256 * 1024 * 1024,
  // Most skills one bundle may contribute, so a pathological archive of tiny skills can't produce an
  // unbounded number of import candidates.
  maxSkillsPerBundle: 256,
  // Structural cap on the number of entries in the OUTER bundle walk (loose files + nested archives),
  // above the per-skill cap so a bundle can carry multiple Skills. Decompressed size (maxBundleBytes)
  // is the real memory guard; this only rejects an archive with a pathological entry count.
